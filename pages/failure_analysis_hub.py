- **What:** An area chart showing the number of reported failures per month, broken down by failure mode.

- **Why (Actionability):** This chart helps identify systemic issues. A sudden spike in a specific failure mode (e.g., 'Wire Bond Lift') points to a recent process change or excursion that needs immediate investigation. Conversely, a decreasing trend after a corrective action visually confirms its effectiveness.

It visually explains the goal of an integrated quality system: a problem detected at an OSAT (left) should trigger a failure analysis, which identifies a root cause at the foundry, leading to a corrective action (CAPA) that ultimately results in improved yield (right). It demonstrates a strategic understanding of quality systems.
